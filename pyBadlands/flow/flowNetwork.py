        Resolves ALL of the deposits under sea. We treat them as an isolated
        system as there's no way for sediment to 'build up' and become land.

        For under-sea deposition, we fill the sink node up to the sea level
        (less epsilon). If there's too much, we try to distribute the excess
        sediment evenly among the neighbours.

        deposition_volume reflects the initial or 'requested' deposition state
        where most nodes will have too much sediment. deposition_change is
        updated after resolution.

        Right now, we're assuming that each node will have an 'unfilled'
        neighbour where excess sediment can be deposited. It is unlikely that
        all of the neighbours will be 'filled' - but it is theoretically
        possible. Rather than try to address the (complex and slow) problem of
        modelling underwater sediment movement in high deposition density
        regions, we're just going to discard sediment if we can't easily find
